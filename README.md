## Schedule

3 x 2 x 100 mins on February 21, 28 and March 7:

* 15:30 - 17:00 session 1
* 17:00 - 17:30 break
* 17:30 - 19:00 session 2

## Location

Hybrid: in-person at the Budapest campus and on Zoom. Zoom URL shared in Moodle.

## Syllabus

Please find in the `syllabus` folder of this repository.

## Technical Prerequisites

1. You need a laptop with any operating system and stable Internet connection.
2. Please make sure that Internet/network firewall rules are not limiting your access to unusual ports (e.g. 22, 8787, 8080, 8000), as we will heavily use these in the class (can be a problem on a company network). CEU WiFi should have the related firewall rules applied for the class.
3. Please install Slack, and join the #ï»¿ba-de3-2021 channel in the `ceu-bizanalytics` group.
4. When joining remotely, it's highly suggested to get a second monitor where you can follow the online stream, and keep your main monitor for your own work. The second monitor could be an external screen attached to your laptop, e.g. a TV, monitor, projector, but if you don't have access to one, you may also use a tablet or phone to dial-in to the Zoom call.

## Class Schedule

Will be updated from week to week.

## Week 1

**Goal**: learn how to run and schedule R jobs in the cloud.

### Background: Example use-cases and why to use R in the cloud?

Excerpts from https://daroczig.github.io/talks

* "A Decade of Using R in Production" (Real Data Science USA - R meetup)
* "Getting Things Logged" (RStudio::conf 2020)
* "Analytics databases in a startup environment: beyond MySQL and Spark" (Budapest Data Forum 2018)

### Welcome to AWS!

1. Use the central CEU AWS account: https://ceu.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
2. Secure your access key(s), other credentials and any login information ...

    <details><summary>... because a truly wise person learns from the mistakes of others!</summary>

    > "When I woke up the next morning, I had four emails and a missed phone call from Amazon AWS - something about 140 servers running on my AWS account, mining Bitcoin"
    -- [Hoffman said](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/01/06/dev_blunder_shows_github_crawling_with_keyslurping_bots)

    > "Nevertheless, now I know that Bitcoin can be mined with SQL, which is priceless ;-)"
    -- [Uri Shaked](https://medium.com/@urish/thank-you-google-how-to-mine-bitcoin-on-googles-bigquery-1c8e17b04e62)

    So set up 2FA (go to IAM / Users / username / Security credentials / Assigned MFA device): https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam

    PS probably you do not really need to store any access keys, but you may rely on roles (and the Key Management Service, and the Secrets Manager and so on)
    </details>

3. Let's use the `eu-west-1` Ireland region

## Getting access to EC2 boxes

**Note**: we follow the instructions on Windows in the Computer Lab, but please find below how to access the boxes from Mac or Linux as well when working with the instances remotely.

1. Create (or import) an SSH key in AWS (EC2 / Key Pairs): https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#KeyPairs:sort=keyName
2. Get an SSH client:

    * Windows -- Download and install PuTTY: https://www.putty.org
    * Mac -- Install PuTTY for Mac using homebrew or macports

        ```sh
        sudo brew install putty
        sudo port install putty
        ```

    * Linux -- probably the OpenSSH client is already installed, but to use the same tools on all operating systems, please install and use PuTTY on Linux too, eg on Ubuntu:

        ```sh
        sudo apt install putty
        ```

3. ~~Convert the generated pem key to PuTTY format~~No need to do this anymore, AWS can provide the key as PPK now.

    * GUI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html#putty-private-key
    * CLI:

        ```sh
        puttygen key.pem -O private -o key.ppk
        ```

4. Make sure the key is readable only by your Windows/Linux/Mac user, eg

    ```sh
    chmod 0400 key.ppk
    ```

### Create and connect to an EC2 box

1. Create an EC2 instance

    0. Optional: create an Elastic IP for your box
    1. Go the the Instances overview at https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#Instances:sort=instanceId
    2. Click "Launch Instance"
    3. Pick the `Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type` AMI
    4. Pick `t3a.small` instance type (see more [instance types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types))
    5. Click "Review and Launch"
    6. Pick a unique name for the security group after clicking "Edit Security Group"
    7. Set some tags for resource tracking:
        * Class: `DE3`
        * Owner: `Gergely Daroczi`
        * Name: `daroczig-de3-prep`
    8. Click "Launch"
    9. Select your AWS key created above and launch

2. Connect to the box

    1. Specify the hostname or IP address

    ![](hhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/images/putty-session-config.png)

    2. Specify the "Private key file for authentication" in the Connection category's SSH/Auth pane
    3. Set the username to `ubuntu` on the Connection/Data tab
    4. Save the Session profile
    5. Click the "Open" button
    6. Accept & cache server's host key

Alternatively, you can connect via a standard SSH client on a Mac or Linux, something like:

```sh
chmod 0400 /path/to/your/pem
ssh -i /path/to/your/pem -p 8000 ubuntu@ip-address-of-your-machine
```

### Install RStudio Server on EC2

1. Look at the docs: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download-server
2. Download Ubuntu `apt` package list

    ```sh
    sudo apt update
    ```

    Optionally upgrade the system:

    ```sh
    sudo apt upgrade
    ```

3. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    sudo apt install r-base gdebi-core
    ```

4. Try R

    ```sh
    R
    ```

    For example:

    ```r
    1 + 4
    hist(mtcars$hp)
    ```

    Exit:

    ```r
    q()
    ```

5. Install RStudio Server

    ```sh
    wget https://download2.rstudio.org/server/bionic/amd64/rstudio-server-2022.02.0-443-amd64.deb
    sudo apt install gdebi-core
    sudo gdebi rstudio-server-2022.02.0-443-amd64.deb
    ```

6. Check process and open ports

    ```sh
    rstudio-server status
    sudo rstudio-server status
    sudo systemctl status rstudio-server
    sudo ps aux| grep rstudio

    sudo apt install net-tools
    sudo netstat -tapen | grep LIST
    sudo netstat -tapen
    ```

7. Look at the docs: http://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/

### Connect to the RStudio Server

1. Confirm that the service is up and running and the port is open

    ```console
    ubuntu@ip-172-31-12-150:~$ sudo netstat -tapen | grep LIST
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8787            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          49065       23587/rserver
    tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          15671       1305/sshd
    tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      0          15673       1305/sshd
    ```

2. Try to connect to the host from a browser on port 8787, eg http://foobar.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8787
3. Realize it's not working
4. Open up port 8787 in the security group
